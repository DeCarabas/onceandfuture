Todo:

UI:
- Error boxes
- Add/remove rivers
- Add/remove feeds from rivers
- Add/remove river sets
- Re-order rivers
- Import/export OPML

Shipping:
- Re-pack font awesome fonts
- Use packed/minified/precompiled source if it exists

Feed Stuff:
- Implement ATOM cache timeout and RSS skip hours and the like to poll more
  intelligently.
- Clip titles that are too long. (Because seriously.)

Bugs:
- b0rk's feed refreshes completely every time there's a new article; fix it!
- Feed settings


Later:
- Extract enclosures and the like, store locally (in the DB) and present them
  in the river. (Then do UI work to expose audio enclosures and the like.)


Far future:
- For the future, we'll probably need options on individual feeds for
  processing to make them better. It is possible to over-engineer this so be
  careful.
- Implement pubsubhubbub?
