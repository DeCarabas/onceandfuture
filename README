Todo:

UI:
- Remove feeds from rivers
  - Getting sources but still need: fetch source progress and error
  - Then need to make it prettier
  - Then need to add unsubscribe action
- Add/remove river sets
- Rename river
- Re-order rivers
- Import/export OPML
- Sign Out
- Update Progress
- More/less UX is jarring.

Back-end Stuff:
- Cancellation tokens everywhere
- Single HttpClient (or factory) everywhere
- Measure things:
  - Number of concurrent HTTP connections
  - Latencies of various things
- Replace inline log with static log method
- Pull images from content soup rather than link soup if present.
- Login cookie cache scrubber

Shipping:
- Re-pack font awesome fonts
- Use packed/minified/precompiled source if it exists

Feed Stuff:
- Implement ATOM cache timeout and RSS skip hours and the like to poll more
  intelligently.
- Clip titles that are too long. (Because seriously.)

Bugs:
- b0rk's feed refreshes completely every time there's a new article; fix it!

Later:
- Extract enclosures and the like, store locally (in the DB) and present them
  in the river. (Then do UI work to expose audio enclosures and the like.)
- Trim rivers that get too big

Far future:
- For the future, we'll probably need options on individual feeds for
  processing to make them better. It is possible to over-engineer this so be
  careful.
- Implement pubsubhubbub?
